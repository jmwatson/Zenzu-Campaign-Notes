**Recap for The Southern Campaign: Act 1 - The Celestial Orbaka**
 
**Celestial Weapon - Yuhona**
 
After traveling for some time and completing minor quests along the way, the Adventurers arrive at Farell.
 
Unfortunately, the only tavern in Farell was taken up by various travelers and especially the Diamond Hounds, a famous mercenary group. But a kind tavern maid, a red headed woman named Nora Pyreson invited the Adventurers to stay at her family's farm. At the farm the Adventurers met Nora's parents, Pomfrey (father), Muriel (mother), and siblings Daniel and Melody.
 
In the morning, the Adventurers learned that the various farms, including the Pyreson farm had chickens being stolen, among other supplies. They discovered goblin tracks leading away from the chicken coop. As Adventurers searched the woods, three little goblins tumbled out of the bushes and were clearly frightened of the Adventurers. They also begged the Adventurers to not kill them and instead help them as their cave has been seized by "Three large yellow hairy things".
 
At the cave, the Adventurers liberate the goblins from their bugbear captors and return back to Farell thinking they have solved the problem of the missing supplies. Upon returning, Nora explains that Kaskus Murinae, running the nearby Murinae farm, was the suspect of all the missing farming supplies. Shortly after, a Pyreson farm hand ran in and yelled that Kaskus had taken the Pyreson family hostage. Adventurers and Nora rushed to the farm.
 
At the farm, they ran into Kaskus standing just outside the main door of the farm. Kaskus notices the Adventurers, sees their weapons, and orders his men to attack. As this happens, Nora sneaks away.
 
Eventually the Adventurers defeat a few bandits. Kaskus, infuriated, reveals his true form, that of a Wererat and makes a few high pitched squeaking noises. Shortly after, three giant rats appear as enemy reinforcements. Kaskus later drags Daniel Pyreson out (Nora's brother) and guts him with his sword, leaving Daniel to die.
 
Nora mysteriously reappears from some bushes near the farmhouse entrance, with tears in her eyes, and crying in rage over Kaskus stabbing her brother. She turns towards the Adventurers, starts to radiate energy, and a glowing symbol appears on her neck, the very same symbol that was shown on the Orb. She tells Adventurers to prepare themselves and, in a burst of firey light, Nora disappears, but a beautiful, majestic, crimson longsword appears in front of the Paladin. The sword maintains a female voice, speaks to the Adventurers telepathically and says the following:
 
**"Heroes! I am Yuhona, named after and forged with the Star of Fire! With my power, let us burn away the forces of evil!"**
 
The sword beckons the Paladin to pick it up and it bonds with him spiritually. The Adventurers use their newfound weapon to strike back at Kaskus and his group, eventually defeating them. They also manage to resuscitate Daniel.
 
The sword, Yuhona, reveals that she is one of Halcyon’s weapons and provides the Adventurers what she knows of Halcyon and his armory.
 
- She was a member of Halcyon’s Chosen in the Fallen War centuries ago.
- All weapons are forged from the spirits of Halcyon’s first chosen.
- Various knowledge of the other celestial weapons and former members are blocked as a security mechanism, for example, if she were to be acquired by evil beings somehow.
 
With a celestial weapon in hand, and the orb recharging, the Adventurers decide to return to Demetrius and report their findings.        
**Celestial Weapon - Yinjang**
 
The Adventurers return to the tower and are greeted by Four Eyes again. He mentions that Demetrius left for the southern port city, Port Rose, to acquire reagents for his experiments. After going to Port Rose and completing several quests there, the Adventurers find out that Demetrius had already left to return to his tower and that he and his carriage actually passed the Adventurers on his way back; both parties were unaware of the other.
 
The Adventurers return to the tower and just as it comes into view, they see a large explosion at the very top of the tower. As they rush towards the entrance, they notice demons have overtaken the tower somehow and some of Demetrius’s apprentices and tower caretakers have been killed. Four Eyes is also nowhere to be found.
 
Adventurers fight to the top of the tower, killing many demons along the way. At the top they find a massive dead Balor beginning to dissipate back into the Hells. Propped against a wall is Demetrius, impaled by one of the Balor’s horns. Demetrius is dying, but manages to explain that a summoning ritual for a minor demon was sabotaged and summoned the demon’s master instead. He asks the Adventurers to hand over the orb so he can imbue it with stronger magic, while this happens, he also asks the Adventurers to find Four Eyes.
 
Four Eyes is found trapped in the library under a mound of fallen bookshelves and books. When the Adventurers return with Four Eyes to Demetrius, Demetrius hands back an improved locator orb and frees Four Eyes from his service, he then implores the Adventurers to save his country before passing.
 
As Demetrius dies, an enchanted barrier to his personal room dissipates and tower servants and apprentices emerge from his room, having been told to hide in there by Demetrius during the fight with the Balor. They begin to mourn the death of their teacher, some also begin cleaning up the tower. One of the servants suggests to the Adventurers a disciple named Ajax seemed to act weirdly in recent days and believe he may be the one responsible for the sabotage. As the Adventurers descend the tower, they notice Four Eyes is missing, however he reappears at the bottom of the tower, sporting a huge grin.
 
Four Eyes celebrates the fact that he is free and wishes to join the Adventurers. He laments that Demetrius has passed and the fact that prior to the recent empowering, the orb could not reveal celestial weapons within a certain radius. As Four Eyes says this, he begins to glow and opens his sealed main eye to reveal a symbol:
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240830122326-0.png)  

Four Eyes then transforms into a pair of bracers and proclaims:
 
**"Greetings friends, I am Yinjang, named after and forged with the star of Eyes, with my power, let us strike down evil with unparalleled precision.****"**
 
Yinjang then bonds spiritually with the Rogue. Yuhona and Yinjang also proceed to chat among themselves privately, mostly about their new lives.
 
The Adventurers return the King and his Advisor for their next steps.      **The Enemy Revealed**
 
As the Adventurers enter Vermillias, they notice large numbers of soldiers have gathered. The King is heading north, to lead the country’s defense against the strange yellow invaders. Advisor Vanosia explains that while the Adventurers were away, a large scale battle has broken out in the country’s northern regions, she suggests to the Adventurers to explore some ruins south of the city, where a mighty battle occurred in the Fallen War. She begs the Adventurers to find the other weapons first and that the army will do their best to stop the invaders from invading the mainland.
 
After several days exploring the southern forest, the Adventurers come across an abandoned fort, much of which has been slowly reclaimed by nature. They also come under attack by four of the strange invaders. After finding a hidden trapdoor in the fort, the Adventurers proceed to explore the fort’s mysterious underground chambers. After fighting off more of the strange invaders, the group enters a room and come across an invader that appears to be a mage of some sort, this mage hands off an item to a courier and tells the courier to “Bring this to the War Master”, the courier enters a portal and disappears, the portal also dissipates.
 
The mage reveals that they are known as Githyanki and they have invaded Stellos on orders of their War Master. The Adventurers then engage and defeat this group of Githyanki. After the battle, they examine the room. An opened box reveals a letter that reads:
 
_Greetings Commander Islen,_  
_We have just scored a major victory. Inside this box you will find a gem of undeath,used by our foes to enslave the souls of the fallen. Unfortunately we have not found a way to destroy the gem. Such a dangerous artifact can not be kept on the front lines, lest our enemies recover it. We entrust the gem with you. One of Halcyon’s warriors has sealed it so it should not pose a problem to you or your men. Please keep this safe and hidden._
 
_Lastly, General Belen does request a platoon of sappers if you can spare them, please send them to Farshire, we will soon begin the assault on Dracaris Keep and hopefully liberate some of the Fae in the area._
 
- _Scout Commander Murano Grieve_.
 
Yuhona and Yinjang recognize the names mentioned in the letter as leaders during the Fallen War, but not members of Halcyon’s original chosen.
 
After resting, the orb begins to glow again, revealing a symbol and an arrow pointing to the northeast.
 
**Recap for The Southern Campaign: Act 2 - The Githyanki**
 
**Celestial Weapon - Niqil**
 
The orb has revealed another strange symbol, and points northeast.

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240830122326-1.png)  

The Adventurers head in that direction, past Farell and towards a larger town, Faeshire. When they arrive they find a town in somewhat of a panic and worry, as the town’s children have slowly been disappearing.
 
Faeshire is a town named such for the close proximity of local fae creatures. However the locals believe the fae could be responsible for the disappearing children as “there have never been screams, or bloodshed involved, perhaps fae magic is involved?”. Furthermore, the town’s local Ranger, **Reuben Emmonsi**, has also disappeared.
 
As the players ask around to find out clues about the disappearances, they come across the **Diamond Hounds**, the famous mercenary group that has traveled around Vermillias. The leader is a handsome, rugged man named **Avery Rapax**. Avery and his group have come across what appears to be were-creatures and believes that these creatures are the ones responsible for the kidnappings. Avery then asks the Adventurers to lend them a hand in fighting off the were-creatures.
 
The Adventurers agree and the groups try to perform a pincer maneuver and attempt to surround the were-creatures, Avery mentions he will signal the Adventurers if his group finds the were-creatures and begins an attack. However as the Adventurers get deeper into the wood, they are attacked by fae. After easily fighting off the small sprites and pixies, a werewolf attacks the party. The werewolf does not put up much of a fight however as it is revealed to be a man in costume, but more importantly he is knocked out by an actual werebear! The werebear then attacks the Adventurers but reveals himself to be Reuben, Faeshire’s ranger. Shortly after, the Adventurers see an explosion in the sky and recognize it as Avery’s signal, simultaneously, Reuben panics and also runs towards the explosion, yelling something about aiding his “master”.
 
The Adventurers give chase and come across what would normally be a peaceful glade, with a nearby cave. Avery and his group have appeared to capture a Unicorn and are preparing to kill it. He reveals that he’s tired of saving people left and right and wants to sell the Unicorn’s horn and retire a very very wealthy man, and has framed the fae for kidnapping the children. Reuben charges at Avery only to be killed in the process. As the Adventurers attack the Diamond Hounds, the Diamond Hounds succeed in killing the Unicorn.
 
However, moments later, the Unicorn begins to glow. Blinding lights emit from the Unicorn as a symbol appears on the Unicorn’s muzzle:

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240830122326-2.png)  

A voice says:  
**"Greetings heroes, I am Niqil, named after and forged with the star of Purity, with my power, let us be protected against the forces of evil."**
 
The holy spear Niqil then bonds with the Monk.
 
With the 3rd celestial weapon in hand, the Adventurers defeat the Diamond Hounds and return the kidnapped children to their parents in Faeshire.      **Celestial Weapon - Ano**
 
The Adventurers hear about a ship that has sailed into the Hemith, a second largest city in Vermillias. This particular ship hails from the Sword Coast and a wizard is said to be one of the passengers. The Adventurers set out to find this wizard with the hopes that he may have more information on the Githyanki.
 
After performing some tasks for the wizard, he reveals that the Githyanki are a psionic warrior race that were previously enslaved by creatures known as Mindflayers, or Illithid. He also warns that the Githyanki are allied with something very terrible, but can’t remember what. Soon after parting ways with the wizard, the Celestial Orb reveals a symbol in the direction to the northeast.
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240830122326-3.png)  

As the Adventurers return to Faeshire, the orb continues to point east. Realizing that there exists a small mining town in that direction, the players depart Faeshire and head to Kermis by escorting a caravan.
 
As they arrive in Kermis, they are told that residents are being kidnapped by a variety of monsters, namely lizardmen and orcs; however it is reported that bandits are also working with those creatures. After following some of the lizardmen and orcs, the Adventurers find themselves at the entrance of the cave. While navigating the cave, they realize that the lizardmen, orcs, and bandits are behaving very oddly and are unable to communicate in any fashion. At the end of the cave the Adventurers find Kermis residents held in cages, strangely there is also a corpse of a Githyanki.
 
The true enemy behind the kidnapping finally reveals themselves, Mind Flayers. Led by a Mind Flayer Arcanist, the Mind Flayers nearly defeat the Adventurers. As the Arcanist latches itself onto the Cleric’s head and prepares to devour the Cleric’s brain, the Adventurers’ then hear a voice.
 
**“Heroes... I am Ano, named after and forged with the star of Minds, with my power, let us outwit evil and bring ruin to its plans.”**
 
The Arcanist releases the Cleric and transforms into a crown. Ano explains his actions and then bonds with the Cleric, the Adventurers have acquired the fourth weapon. Ano’s transformation also released a shockwave of psionic energy, stunning the three other Mind Flayers and turning the battle into the Adventurers’ favor. Battered and badly wounded, the Adventurers defeat the remaining Mind Flayers and rescue Kermis’s citizens.
 
**The Siege of Kermis**
 
The newly acquired weapon, Ano, reveals that the Githyanki he devoured as a Mind Flayer had knowledge of an upcoming attack on Kermis. The Adventurers quickly return to Kermis to find it in flames, the people fleeing for safety, and Githyanki overwhelming the town’s guards. Invoking the power of the Celestial Weapons, the Adventurers charge into battle, giving the citizens time to escape.
 
Suddenly, a wave of fire tears through the town’s guards as the Githyanki have called in one of their mysterious allies as recalled by the Sword Coast Wizard.
 
A Red Dragon.
 
Behind it, even more Githyanki advance upon the town. The Commander of the town’s guards leads what remains of his forces to hold off the Githyanki as the Adventurers begin battle against the dragon.
 
After a grueling battle, including the death of some civilians, the Dragon retreats. The battered Adventurers find themselves surrounded by the rest of the Githyanki. Just as defeat begins to look inevitable, a war cry sounds from the east as hundreds of Dwarves rush in to defend the Adventurers.
 
Though the Githyanki are beaten back, the town of Kermis has been destroyed. The Dwarves mention they come from a Dwarven city just northeast of Kermis, but they are only a temporary relieving force, having used illusion magic to bolster their numbers. Though the Dwarves will honor the alliance made 600 years ago during the First War, they need more time to prepare their army.
 
As the Dwarves take in the survivors of Kermis, the Celestial orb reveals a new symbol, indicating that it is to the west.

**Recap for The Southern Campaign: Act 3 - The Final Weapons**
 
**Celestial Weapon - Heshugon**      As the orb still glows with the following symbol in the western direction:

![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240830122326-5.png)  

The Adventurers make their way to various western locales. As they arrive at the Crossroads barracks and trading station, the orb points northwest, towards the holy city of Ellith. Ellith is another major city in Vermillias, and the primary God worshiped here is Eldath. As they arrive in Ellith, the party is accosted by Dawnmaster Kadeus, the Captain of the City Guard; the reason being that the Cleric is a follower of Talos. Before Kadeus and the guards can advance on the Adventurers, the Grand Priestess of Eldath, Leerala approaches and declares the Adventurers under her protection.
 
Leerala shows the Adventurers around the city as well as throwing them a welcoming party and much joy was had by all who attended. The Grand Priestess also mentions that she has been crafting magical armor for the heroes and that she will be blessing the armor tomorrow and then given to the Adventurers.
 
However, the morning after the party, the city is thrown into chaos as Githyanki have begun an attack. Fortunately the sheer number of holy defenders in the city prevents the city from being overtaken and the Adventurers rush to the Temple of Eldath to aid Leerala.
 
As the Adventurers fight their way to the center of the Temple, they see a large Githyanki, General Galiskar, with Leerala impaled on his spear. Surrounding them are more Githyanki soldiers as well as corpses of temple defenders. Another Githyanki named Ajaxis destroys the crafted armor and also reveals himself as “Ajax” the disciple that betrayed Demetrius. Leerala continues to defy and fight against Galiskar but is stabbed again and kicked aside.
 
The Adventurers find themselves vastly outnumbered until Leerala rises from the dead, with a symbol appearing on her shoulder.
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240830122326-6.png)
      
With a burst of energy, Heshugon - the Star of Life, sheds her mortal form, changing into a gigantic maul that bonds with the Fighter.
 
**"Well hello there Heroes! I am Heshugon, named after and forged with the star of Life, with my power, let us destroy those who live for evil"**
 
The burst of energy also revives the fallen temple defenders who then block out the Githyanki soldiers, leaving the Adventurers to fight Ajax, Galiskar, and their personal guards. Eventually all the Githyanki are defeated and the Adventurers rest, resupply, and prepare to head to the mountains north of Vermillias, as the orb has once again displayed a symbol.
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240830122326-7.png)
    **Celestial Weapon - Rugony**
 
As the Adventurers travel along the path back to the Crossroads, they come across an old man who claims to be sent by the king. The man lures in the heroes with what seems like a gift, before the gift explodes into a fireball and the old man reveals himself to be another Red Dragon. A battle ensues as the Red Dragon calls forth Githyanki and half-dragon allies. However the heroes have gained experience in fighting dragons and soon overcome and defeat this one, before resuming their journey.
 
After resting at Crossroads, the Adventurers take the northern path and eventually meet a panicked and crying soldier. The soldier explains that his unit was ambushed as they made their way north to reinforce the northern fortress city - Fort Rubion. More concerning was that a githyanki holding a weird purple gem began reanimating the soldier’s fallen comrades. Realizing this gem is the gem of undeath taken from the abandoned fort in the southwest, the Adventurers hurry to stop this new threat.
 
They arrive at a clearing where a battle has taken place. Undead humans roam about as a peculiar Githyanki channels energy from the gem and raises more corpses to fight for him. Surrounding him is a sphere of energy, protecting him, as three nearby Githyanki act as conduits for this shield. Other Githyanki stand by as guards.
 
With more and more corpses being raised, the Adventurers charge headlong into battle. With five celestial weapons in hand, the Adventurers invoke all of their powers to try to even the battle. Eventually the three shielding Githyanki fall and the Githyanki necromancer soon also is slain in battle and the gem destroyed.
 
In the aftermath, the soldier from before mysteriously reappears, but appears much more lively than before. He explains that he was not actually part of the ambushed group but is delighted that the Adventurers were able to free the souls of the other soldiers and that the group has now earned his trust and his power. Before the heroes can question him, he removes a glove to reveal a symbol on his hand.
 ![Exported image](Exported%20image%2020240830122326-8.png)  

**“We meet at last heroes, I am Rugony, named after and forged with the star of Honor, with my power, let us be unwavering in the face of evil."**
 
Rugony then transforms into a scarf and bonds with the Bard. The sixth weapon has been found at last, much earlier than the Adventurers had anticipated. They then continue north to Fort Rubion.  
**Recap for The Southern Campaign: Act 4 - Finale**
 
**Finding the Guardian - Hemmen**
 
In Fort Rubion the Adventurers are gathered by Vanosia and she explains that with all 6 weapons gathered, they should seek the guidance of the Guardian of the Tombs, a legendary figure said to guard over the tombs of Halcyon’s original warriors. The only clue as to the whereabouts of the Guardian is that the Tombs are located in the Golden Mountains and that an ancient path lies beyond the Burgundy River.
 
After a few days of locating and then crossing the river, the Adventurers are approached by an elf, Corwin, who asks them to assist him and his brethren in retrieving some supplies in a nearby Elven village. This part of Vermillias is settled by Forest Elves, but after Kermis fell the treetop Elven city of Verdessin was attacked by the Githyanki. When Verdessin was destroyed, many smaller Elven villages were abandoned.
 
After a brief skirmish with a small party of Githyanki, Corwin and his elves retrieve the supplies. In return, Corwin reveals that he knows the location of the ancient path, and agrees to lead the Adventurers to the base of the path. The Adventurers part ways with Corwin, and begin to follow the path and climb the Golden Mountains.
 
Winter weather makes it difficult but the players eventually reach a temple but the doors do not open. Near the temple there is a large carved mural depicting four fallen angels. Suddenly the Adventurers hear explosions and the sounds of a battle. As they approach the battleground they see a large silver dragon crash to the earth, with a red dragon circling above. Githyanki on the ground have just finished defeating a group of dwarves and start to advance on the fallen silver dragon, the red dragon also starts descending.
 
The Adventurers defeat the red dragon and the Githyanki, only to find the silver dragon disappears. The players return to the temple and find that the doors have opened. Inside they meet the silver dragon, Hemmenolath, who reveals that she is also Hemmen, the Guardian of the Tombs. Hemmen confirms that the Adventurers are indeed successors to some of Halcyon’s original chosen. She also provides guidance on utilizing an ancient artifact of Vermillias in the capital, the Soul of Fire. Hemmen then receives news that Githyanki have launched an assault on Fort Rubion and opens a portal for the Adventurers to return to the fort.        
**Golzaduun - The Final Battle**
 
The Adventurers appear in the midst of battle and help fend off a Red Dragon as well as hordes of Githyanki. In the aftermath, King Alazar brings them to his war room and reveals that his forces have discovered the Githyanki stronghold, an old Dwarven mountain-city Golzaduun, where they initially entered this world. The King leads his army to fight the Githyanki head on while the Adventurers attempt to reach the forward vanguard to plan their next steps.  
As the Adventurers encounter various Githyanki patrols, many different allies they have helped in their journey arrive to engage the enemy at each encounter and let the Adventurers slip through to reach the forward base. When they arrive, the Elven General in command lays out the situation and a possible way to infiltrate Golzaduun via an ancient escape route.
 
After trekking through the passage, the Adventurers find themselves in the catacombs of Golzaduun. They encounter many dwarven ghosts and other dangers but eventually reach the Githyanki War Master. After wearing down the War Master in combat, she reveals her true form, that of the Fallen Angel Belthoriel. Belthoriel viciously attacks the Adventurers in a fierce battle, easily displaying her power as the Fallen Angel of Conquest. However with the might of the six celestial weapons, the Adventurers defeat Belthoriel. A surprise awaits though, as a hellish portal opens up beneath Belthoriel and many demonic hands drag her to the depths of hell. The Ruler of the Nine Hells himself, Asmodeus, appears. It is revealed that Belthoriel made a pact with Asmodeus, in exchange for her soul, he granted her power. With her defeat, Asmodeus makes good on the pledge and takes Belthoriel to Hell.
 
The Vermillians and Adventurers celebrate their victory and the fulfillment of the prophecy. However the six weapons have gone silent. The Adventurers return to the Tomb of Halcyon’s Chosen where Hemmen reveals that the six weapons have prepared for their afterlife. As each weapon briefly takes on their original form from 600 years ago, they each bid farewell to the Adventurers and thank them for their service to Vermillias.
 
**Epilogue - The Fates of the Adventurers**
 
With that the first campaign ends. In the epilogue, the fate of the Adventurers are revealed.
 
The Paladin lives a normal life until it is discovered a smuggling ring brings more drugs that end up killing many people. While attacking the pirate smuggling fleet, the Paladin dies in a blaze of glory, with Yuhona, the Star of Fire, appearing one more time to aid him.
 
The Fighter returns to his home village of Raban where he brings security to his home and trains a local militia. He eventually dies peacefully in his sleep. It is said his sister eventually moves to the Western Country of Zenzu.
 
The Bard continues to travel the world and departs from Stellos. His songs and tales inspire many that hear them.
 
The Rogue also leaves Stellos, even traveling with the Bard for a while. It is said the small trinkets and gadgets she makes are very valuable.
 
The Monk continues to live a carefree life. His lust for competition and adventure catch up with him in old age as his heart gives out from too much exertion. His body is returned to his monastery where he is then revered as a Grandmaster.
 
The Cleric is disavowed by his former God, but converts to another Wind deity, the same one that his fierce warrior grandmother follows. When he dies of old age, his body is returned to Vermillias.  
Intro:   It has been 60 years since the defeat of Belthoriel. The kingdom of Vermillias has since prospered under the wise rule of King Edwin Alizar XIII. The same however, can not be said of their western neighbor, Zenzu, where our story takes place.
 
The nation of Zenzu is much different than Vermillias. Four main human tribes roam the lands, migrating between parts of Zenzu under their philosophy known as the Cycle of Renewal. The human tribes are joined by high elves, who do not participate in the cycle, but do take part in internal affairs. These five races send their leaders to the only known permanent city in Zenzu, Opalia, where they strive to maintain peace between the tribes, establish laws, and settle conflicts.
  **REGARDING SETTING:**

1. This campaign is set on an island continent (**Stellos**). I guess it is a part of the Forgotten Realms but your characters are natives to your kingdom and don't really know of the main Forgotten Realm continents/locations, but we are using this setting to keep the gods, spells, and other gameplay factors.
2. There are four kingdoms/countries on **Stellos**, for this campaign we are mainly sticking to areas in the western kingdom of **Zenzu**. If you want some information on the other kingdoms to work into your backstory, let me know. Those who played in campaign 1 will have knowledge of Vermillias, but DON'T META. However, some knowledge of Vermillias will be known to the players.
3. Unlike Vermillias 60 years ago, where during that time many humans disregarded the prophecy, the people of Zenzu now believe in the prophecy of Halcyon's Chosen. This is largely because of the events that took place during that time. Also the father of the High Elf leader participated in the original war. However since it has been 60 years, that belief is slowly starting to fade again amongst the non-elf population.
4. In Zenzu, a person is free to worship whomever they please. However, a portion of the population worship Akadi, the elemental goddess of air, I trust you all to look her up yourselves, but the important bits are: Akadi is true neutral, tends to stay away from mortal affairs, and her faith revolves around wind, flying creatures, speed, and basically anything associated with air.
5. Important Note: In actual D&D lore, she feuds with Grumbar, the elemental god of earth, but this will not be the case in our game.
6. Despite what was said above, Akadi isn't worshipped as much as other gods, in fact, this is the same for the other elemental gods, Kossuth is the only one with a significant following.
7. Zenzu consists of 4 "tribes" that follow their philosophy of the Cycle of Renewal, thus the tribes migrate every year between the four main regions of the area. Only three settlements exist, the main one being the capital city of Opalia, in the center of Zenzu. The tribes are ruled by the Council of Five in Opalia.
8. Since this is a nomadic game, there will be very few inns. Zenzuese are very welcoming though so perhaps someone will be willing to share their yurt(s) with you.
9. Otherwise, players can construct and create their own yurts, this will take time and resources as well as player management.
10. Arcane magic, much like the previous campaign is rare, perhaps even more so in this campaign than the last. Nature and religious magic are not uncommon however.
11. **Resurrection magic and components are almost nonexistent.**
