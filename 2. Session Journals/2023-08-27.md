- While long resting at the camp, during the night Toshiro and Cephos start to feel funny with a sore throat and funny feeling skin
- We move to our own tent so we don't infect anyone else if we caught something
- Paladins (Lathander) and reinforcements show up in the morning
- We set out with Marcus and it takes most of the day but at the end of the day we arrive at a town
- The town has a large temple to Eldath
- Special visitor that is expecting us?
- We visit the general store
    
    - Bayarma bought 10 extra rations for Joey
    - Golzaduun – Ancient Dwarven city and is where the final battle with the first Fallen Angel, Belthoriel, took place
    - Golden Mead – 40G (Toshiro purchased and we will partake tonight)
    - Toraduun – local Dwarven town that brews beer that has made their way over to Golzaduun and started to retake/rebuild
- Paladin lady (Dawnmaster Aerina) - "The grand priestess has task her to find us and escort us to the temple"
- Grand priestess (Lusine Doenell – image on left is from when she was young, otherwise she is now 80-90ish years old) greets us and dismisses the Dawnmaster takes us to a meeting room
    
    - The city of Ellith has hosted Vermillias's Heroes of Halcyon before but was betrayed but Lusine ended up finding out her predecessor was one of the chosen ones
- She presents us with some items
    
    - Lantern of Revealing – can reveal invisible beings when used
    - Fiend Killing Mace +1 – Add a 1d6 Radiant when attacking fiends
    - Ring of Evasion – three charges (regains daily) - use a charge to instead succeed a Dex saves
    - Ring of Darkvision
    - Pearl of Power – Command word is, "May nature bless me"
    - Great Sword +1
- The previous grand priestess (Leerala) resurrected Cephos's grandmother
- The mead was the smoothest thing we've ever drank and it didn't have the normal alcohol tastes which made it almost taste not like alcohol
- We head back to the temple and have the meal with the grand priestess
- Cephos and Toshiro's condition flares up and we inform her about it and she purifies the air
- We then tell her the tales of how we got the three artifacts we currently have
- Dinner ends and we all head to our provided room (separate)
- We head out the next day and make it to Crossroads which is mostly a tower watching over two intersecting roads but the startings of a town are popping up around the area
- Make it to Crimson City, meet with the King and introduced by Marcus
- We inform the king that two of us are infected with the fulminating death and he starts to lead us out to the clerics but we inform him normal healing makes I worse
- He then leads us down to a room that contains their Weapons of Halcyon.
    
    - These weapons look dull and lifeless, as their respective Stars already ascended back into the sky.
- Merric touches the spear and it doesn't react but when the King starts to get disappointed the spear glows and becomes opalescent
