- [[Kiihar]] starts off the battle by beating up on [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] but luckily [[Cephos]] had his back and called on his god to help heal the two of them 
- [[Skashoon]] takes aim at him and casts hunter's mark to make sure we keep tabs on him 
- [[Balam]] gives [[Bayarma]] [Invigorate] so that now she's fast as heck
- [[Bayarma]] goes after the helper demons and manages to kill them 
- [[Skashoon]] was knocked unconscious by the flying demon 
- [[Bayarma]] joins in on beating up on [[Kiihar]] 
- [[Kiihar]] - "400 years ago he tried to turn the people of the far east with a water elemental but was stopped by a group of 6 adventurers then but I won't be stopped now!" 
- [[Kiihar]] grabs onto [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] and [[Cephos]] and bashes them together and knocks [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] unconscious 
- [[Bayarma]] with all her holy might calls down the might of her oath to slash at [[Kiihar]] and kill him with an incredible crit and 3rd level smite 
- [[Kiihar]]'s demon form disolves and leaves behind a box that has a rune on it 
- [[Sunwei Tianfu]] and [[Basayar Uurdogo (Temukan Leader)]] shows up with horses and we take the horses and ride to the west 
- [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] manages to grab [[Riku Masay]]'s corpse and pull it onto his horse 
- [[Basayar Uurdogo (Temukan Leader)]] says to [[Skashoon]], "Find you clans men. Save [[Zenzu (Country – West)]]!" 
- [[Basayar Uurdogo (Temukan Leader)]] jumps off and starts casting a very strong wind spell (Wrath of Nature) and [[Sunwei Tianfu]] yells to finish the ritual 
- He holds off the hordes of demons with this spell and deftly out maneuvers the demons, but eventually a spear thrusts up through a large demon and into [[Basayar]] 
- Red dome surrounds the battlefield and encloses the demon outbreak 
- The masked man comes up to the wall of the dome and taps it then turns back and walks away 
- [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] looks to [[Cephos]] and asks, "Do you think they are trapped in there with them?" 
- [[Cephos]] responds, "Yes, I believe so." Talking about the Dragons on the mountain. 
- [[Cephos]], "You've just sentenced them to death" 
- [[Skashoon]], "And you consider this good enough!" 
- [[Relera Imministel]] explains that they didn't foresee this coming 
- Just as [[Skashoon]] is getting ready to lob another volley at [[Relera Imministel]], [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] steps in, "Let's not look at was has happened and lets start working on a way to fix this. As someone who had to leave his homeland because of war, don't look at how you could have prevented it from happening in the first place because you will become stuck in the past with the ghosts who reside there. So, let's learn our lessons from what has happened and start working on a way to fix it."
