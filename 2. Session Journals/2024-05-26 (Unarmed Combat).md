- We fought some people
- Relera pipes up to refute the cheating claim
- Shodaku is the leader of the Hinoko, not Lien Sho
- Toshiro got a cape of billowing and 120 GP
    
    - Cloak of Billowing
- Cephos got an pendent of stabilizing and 120 GP
    
    - Pendent of Stabilizing â€“ Once per long rest if you hit zero HP you automatically stabilize
- As we are walking to the unarmed combat venue, we see one of the teams fighter throwing up and generally not able to fight but they produce a sub who we catch a glimpse of
- The first fighter that Toshiro fights is a little girl that ask for a moment but Toshiro rushes up on her to grab her and pin her to the ground to give her a minute
- As he's grabbing her she turns into a bear
- She nearly takes out Toshiro but not before Toshiro deflects one of her attacks and catches her in the face for a knock out
- The next fight is against a large buff dude fighting for Basayar (Monkhba Esen)
- This fight is a slugfest but Toshiro barely ekes out the win
- The next battle is with Lien Sho's champion (Riku)
- Toshiro is easily taken out by Riku
- For the final fight, the matchup is now Lien Sho vs Mixed 6
