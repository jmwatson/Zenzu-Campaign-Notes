- We borrow some horses and high tail it to Opalia 
- We visit Li for some info on Bennet's and Bantu's 
- [[Ikumi Rindo]] – Chef and owner of Bennets (a fine dining establishment in Opalia) 
- We go in and meet with her and tell her of the amulet and the curse 
- She gets excited and tells all her patrons that she is closing for the day 
- Gets out a very large tome and says she can remove the curse but she needs some information first, mainly stats like height, weight, species 
- Cephos begrudgingly tells her that he is not Half Orc but actually Half Tiger Yaowu 
- She looks up in the book for how to do it and says that she can get most of the items needed but one will be particularly difficult 
    - Horns of a Behir 
    - Tells us they primarily live in mountains and that they are blue and about 12 meters long 
- She sets off to get the other ingredients and tells us to meet her back here with the horns and she'll remove the curse 
- We head to the Bantu's but end of session so instead we go to the wearhouse
