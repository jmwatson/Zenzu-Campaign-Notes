- The battle with Bantu commenced
- Some of us remained on horseback but Toshiro's horse was killed at the start of battle
- Toshiro took out the first assassin but then had to deal with a mage
- Merric was banished to some other plane and upon coming back took a lot of damage
- Cephos healed up both Toshiro and Merric with some divine intervention
- Toshiro used [[Leitosen (The Star of Light)]]'s blink strike to challenge the mage and ended up paralized
- Balam having seen where the mage went (under the cart) lit the mage and cart on fire, killing the mage and freeing Toshiro and the horse attached to the cart, which then ran away
- Balam was then focused as the remaining assassin, fighter and even Bantu attacked her
- Bayaram climbed onto the cart with Bantu and sanctuaried Balam to prevent her from being attacked but Bantu managed to overpower the sanctuary and attack her
- Cephos got back into range of Balam to heal her after she had gone down
- Balam teleported next to the two captives that Toshiro pulled off of the cart and hopefully out of harms way
- Toshiro once again calls upon [[Leitosen (The Star of Light)]] and uses his lightning bolt to hit Bantu and the 2 remaining lackies, killing the fighter and damaging Bantu
- Bantu turns his attacks toward Bayarma but doesn't do a lot of damage
- Toshiro takes out the remaining assassin and then climbs onto the cart and attacks Bantu with action surge and kills Bantu
- Toshiro with [[Leitosen (The Star of Light)]] still stuck in Bantu, "You don't kill innocents."
- Bantu, "My lord, grant me my end!"
- Bantu explodes in bright purple light and his spectral sword of an arm falls to the floor of the cart and then dissolves into the wood of the cart
- Merric tells us of what he saw when he was banished
	- Some where in the Hells
	- Saw a half demon half angel
	- demon/angel saw Merric
	- gave him an evil sly smile and then he was transported back
- The group discussed next steps
	- Loot bodies and check for Sehi Jujin symbols on captives with lantern
	- Round up the horses and carts and return to Opalia
	- Go to [[Lai Tenko]] and return his wife and daughter (if that's who they are)
	- If they are still in danger we can put them up in a couple of safe places
		- With Hido's wife and daughter
		- In our warehouse
		- Ask Li to stash them somewhere safe
	- Go to Bayarma's clan and get the reagent needed to cure Cephos
- After game discussion we figured out who the half demon/half angel was - **Myrstallas**
- Xavier gave us the thing we found in the mountain with the dragons, [[Elegy of Fallen Angels]]
