- Hochiro
- Battle happens but we manage to talk the smaller demons to either not engage or help us take on Gomei
- Balam manages to get to the spare the child from the demon serum and the father and child and mother all embrace and tell us thanks
- "Listen, with father dead, it looks like we aren't returning to the main tribe anytime soon"
- "If we want to join the rebellion, go to Salvation Lake and seek out the Oni Kiri"
- They pack up their camp in the night and leave, we head out in the morning
- Cephos and Toshiro confront Skashoon about his self harming and try to figure out the mystery of is blood
- Some properties is that when something is coated in his blood it gains +8 damage
- A theory that Cephos has is that his clansmen were used in the creation of the sleeping sickness and the Fulminating Death
- We all take a hot tub bath during one of the long rests, mostly because Toshiro stinks but also it's been a while since we've had proper facilities
- Yin Jiang blips with 3 arrows for a split second and we ask about what happened and he just says that for the briefest of moments 2 other arrows appeared point to the south and to the south east and we ask them to keep us appraised of anything that happens similar to that
- As we start making camp at the forest line the people on watch notice some rustling in the bushes so Toshiro hides behind a tree, but the rest of camp sees a girl and couple of adults emerge and the girl looks like this ![[Keri (teen).png]]
