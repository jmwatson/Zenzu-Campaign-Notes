- Guard on the other side of the door yells, "Run, tell master Chojin!"
- We battle 3 of the guards while the other runs off yelling for help
- After the battle we check the guards for identifying marks but don't find any
- We explore the area that the guards were living in and find some stairs leading up
- As we ascend the stairs Bayarma hears people talking and she catches some of what they are saying, "Leave the unimportant stuff! Get the artifacts out of here!"
