- The fighting continues 
- [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] sees a commotion ahead of him and runs towards it and sees [[Riku Masay]] and a couple of his lakys fighting some guards near a priestess 
- [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] runs into the fight and [[Riku Masay]] calls him out, so [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] lightning bolts him and his two friends 
- They proceed to pummel [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] 
- While this is happening [[Bayarma]] is single handedly taking on 3 demons to the north, one of which was a red demon ape (sorta like red hulk or or evil harambe) 
- We manage to save the priestess that [[Riku Masay]] was trying kill by [[Merric]]/[[Skashoon]]/[[Cephos]]/[[Balam]] joining the fight and knocking [[Riku Masay]] unconscious 
- [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] ties him up and then picks him up and starts carrying him 
- In the city underneath Bantu's 
- As soon as he says that, two blades appear, one in his chest and one cutting off his head (it's [[Zant]]) 
- He tells us that he's just here to make sure traitors are dealt with 
- [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] and [[Skashoon]] try to attack but [[Zant]] uses his ability on them and they feel abandoned by the party and start to walk off 
- [[Zant]] disappears and as soon as he does both [[Skashoon]] and [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] snap back to themselves 
- [[Cephos]] goes to talk to [[Toshiro (Svender Berg)]] and he explains that [[Zant]]'s ability made him believe that nobody in the party wanted him and that he was depressed 
- The last priestess comes out and restores some of the parties spells/superiority die with a spell and starts to head to the ritual 
- As she does this a black sphere envelopes her and we hear a neck being snapped and out steps [[Kiihar]] who says he's going have better odds this time and summons a bunch of demons to fight us
