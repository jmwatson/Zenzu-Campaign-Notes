- Renzo meets us in the bar, tells us his name here is Kazae and asks what we are doing here
- We tell him we are trying to make contact with the Oni Kiri to help take out the demon presence so the red bubble can be brought down
- He tells us that if we trust him to follow along and he'll get us out of this alive
- then this guy barges into the tent and says, "Move aside this is official business of the Hinoko!"
- Kyoji says, "Anyone interfering will be taken away."

- They put us in shackles and disarm us and put blindfolds on and lead us away from the tent and put us in a wagon
- They are supposed to be taken to Execution Site B
- Ogaroe will kill us all anyway
- Bayarma uses Divine Sense to sense where the folks holding us are located
- Someone ambushes the wagon and the demons outside move away from the cart
- Renzo frees us from our shackles and opens up a false bottom on the wagon and provides us weapon, but those with artifact weapons just summon our weapons
- We fight off the demons escorting us with the help of some associates of his
