- We climbed a thing
- Cephos convinces Toshiro to drink some of his moon juice to help him catch flags
- To prep, Toshiro drinks a bit of his moon juice to help him with catching flags and Cephos gives Toshiro his ring of dexterity to help out as well
- Right before starting the event, Toshiro and Cephos huddle up to give each other a pep talk and Cephos asks Toshiro to hit him in face
- Toshiro hits Cephos a few times in the face which unlocks Cephos's Yaowu abilities and he comes back and manages to hit Toshiro who was honestly surprised he hadn't been hit yet
- Cephos grumbles about Toshiro using lightning on him on the last hit
- Lots of flags have been caught and we're making decent progress
- Cephos stumbles a bit between the second and third ledges
- After the stumble Cephos and Toshiro hit their stride and start catching and climbing so quickly
- At this point the crowd is going nuts
- After Cephos makes the last ledge he has trouble with the flags adding to their score but still a very quick time
- Finally, he roars at the mountain and the last flag pops out with Toshiro easily catching it
- "That's not fair, he was cheating!" yelled from the crowd (Lien Sho)
