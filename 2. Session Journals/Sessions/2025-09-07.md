- The Oyabun wants to meet with us
- One of the hooded figures cast something on the cart and now it doesn't leave tracks
- We are headed back to the tent city and right before entering the city the cart drops us off and the guy and girl driving it head back away from town
- Renzo hands us a bag of gold (60g) and tells us to find some lodging for the night and he'll find us in the morning
- Toshiro takes the bag and heads into town looking for lodging (a white flag)
- We find lodging that will house all of us and pay for a night plus breakfast the next day
- Toshiro and Merric decide to drink the rest of the night and goes and grabs a bottle of Mijo from the hosts
- Bayarma and Skashoon go out to the communal area and start talking with the hosts about any downsides to becoming demons
- The next morning during breakfast Toshiro asks a few more questions about navigating the town and is told to try to avoid the demons as they can be a pain to deal with but didn't know more than that
- Renzo (Kazae) finds us during breakfast and puts us in a cart and we head to the southeast under the guise that we are headed to a job
- We make to the hills southeast of town and Renzo tells us that we are walking the rest of the way on foot and we get out of the cart and head further into the hills
- A little after getting off the cart Renzo said we needed to be blindfolded for the next bit and he led us through the hills to this crevasse that leads into a cave
- We take out blindfolds off and head through the crevasse into the cave and while waiting Renzo, Merric, Bayarma and Toshiro find a bottle of alcohol and have a little drink
- After comparing roguish tactics Renzo gets a stern look on his face looking past Toshiro toward the entrance and that's when Kyoji darkens the entrance and announces, "I've finally found you... The Oni Kiri!"
