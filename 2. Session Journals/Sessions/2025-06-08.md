- A scream in the middle of the first watch
- Keri and Otis and Merle are nowhere to be found

> **Sehiju:** What's this? More test subjects? Good, GOOD!
> **Teafing:** Hang on, that's no mere skeleton, that is... Sehiju
>
> **Sehiju:** Oh? HOW INTERESTING! Halcyon's new chosen!
> **Leitosen:** Sehiju! This must be a destined meeting, you are to join us correct?
>
> **Sehiju:** Ah, you must be referring to our "oath" to Halcyon and his little prophecy. Yes, yes, well, normally I WOULD join you as required but you see, I've discovered a way to nullify the arrangement. You all can go and fight whichever angel that is supposedly returning, I am making preparations for when you inevitably fail.
> **Leitosen**: Sehiju, you've gone mad!
>
> **Sehiju**: I was always mad!
> **Sehiju**: Now, die, die so that I may succeed!
