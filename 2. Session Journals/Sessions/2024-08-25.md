- We're running away
- We start out fighting a couple of demons and escort some civilians to safety
- Cephos and Bayarma head over to deal with the demons with some good smite and radiant damage
- Some of the civilians are actually Sehi Jujin and attack us alongside the demons
- Merric runs ahead a bit after taking out the last Sehi Jujin and see Zhao Lin surrounded by 4 demons
- Bayarma tries to vault a wooden wall but instead knocks it down and exposes a couple of demons noming on some dead bodies
- Toshiro uses Bayarma's butt to kinda vault closer to the demons and takes them both out
- Then he sees Zhao surrounded but luckily Balam takes 2 of the 4 demons out and Toshiro runs towards
- Cephos and Merric take out another demon before Toshiro can get there and take out the last demon
- Zhao raises his sword and faces Toshiro which causes him to say, "No, no no! Friend!"
- Toshiro notices that he isn't going to attack him just as he passes by and looks behind him to see Zhao impaled on a large demon centaur's serrated tail
- Zhao tells Toshiro to tell his family he loves them before collapsing on the ground
- Luckily Toshiro notices that he isn't quite dead and calls out for healing help and Balam manage to save him and get him stabilized
- Toshiro turns around and goes absolute ham on the demon centaur killing him and taking his head off before he can act
- Zhao wakes up and can't believe he's alive and thanks Toshiro and Toshiro tells him that his friends saved him with healing magic and that all he did was manage the baddie
- Zhao tells Toshiro that he's very thankful and that he's more than likely going to hang up the sword and gives Toshiro a ring he found that he thinks he'll enjoy
- Carbonated Ring â€“ Acid resistance and 3x long rest can add a drop of liquid to any drink to make it bubbly and taste good
- Zhao tells Toshiro before heading off that he was instructed to protect the priestesses and that the priestesses are needed for a ritual
- To be continued.......
