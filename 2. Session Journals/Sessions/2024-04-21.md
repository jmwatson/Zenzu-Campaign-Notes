    - “Greetings Zenzuese, it is time once again, for the great Zenzu Games! The nation’s best and brightest will be put to the test in competitions of Cooperation, Strength, and Knowledge, the three virtues of Zenzu” “Some of you may ask why have the games during these trying times… why are the games taking place when demons roam our lands…” “Well it is because more so now than ever, we must show Stellos that we remain united. In the face of adversity the four clans must support each other, for if we do not, we will lose to these forces of evil” “Fear not, this is holy land, and demons actively avoid this area.” “For this is Lake Trinity, the site of the final battle 700 years ago, between the Warriors of Halcyon and the Fallen Angels. The holy magic the heroes used back then still linger today, acting as a deterrent against evil fiends.” “So, my friends, comrades, and countrymen, join me as we start the Zenzu Games, and may you all enjoy the festivities!”
