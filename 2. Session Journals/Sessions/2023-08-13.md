- Kiihar deftly avoids a wall of fire without taking damage
- He also attacks and when he misses his bracers started glowing and he says, "No one can avoid Yin Jang"
- He disengages and takes off running, "You can try to stop me but I think your efforts are misplaced." He motions for us to follow and takes off running again.
- We fire a bunch of stuff off at him and manage to down him.
- Something causes a blue glow around him healing him.
- Toshiro and Balam manage to catch up with him.
- He gets up, looks toward the trees and vanishes.
- Toshiro fires at a woman that was peeking out from the tree line but didn't manage to hit her or find any clues about where they went.
- Explosions come from the camp and we regroup and head toward the explosions and screams.
- We come upon a horde of demons at the bridge attacking the refuges and bridge guards who are retreating toward the tower.
- Two individuals stand out as they aren't fleeing as fast.
- I catch one of the individuals and pretend that I slipped to grab their arm and they yell at me to get up and make it to the tower.
- Cephos asks them if they are here to help and they respond they are from Vermillias and they were sent to investigate but it wouldn't make a difference unless we couldn't get everyone to the border tower
- Cephos casts Thaumaturgy and yells at the crowd, "Everybody Move!" To get them to the tower.
- Markus Alexander (Spy commander for Vermillias)
