- Finished up the unarmed combat
- Riku forfeits after standing off against the hooded monk (Wu Si Fong)
- All the crowd is wondering what the heck happened with the final
- We discuss plans to gather info about Li Tenko's family from either Riku, the Lien Sho team's camp or the Wu Si Fong
    
    - The plan is to sneak into their camp if they are all attending the event and then the backup is talking to Wu Si Fong and if that doesn't work, subterfuge to get Riku to talk to us
- After many rounds, Skashoon ekes out the win
