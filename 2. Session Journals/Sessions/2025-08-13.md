- We continue running north and east towards the mountains
- The rest of the group (not Toshiro and Skashoon) run to try to catch up
- We make it to the tree line and Renzo stops and makes some hand gestures and looks at Toshiro and hands over the unconscious condemed guy
- Renzo: "Look, I need to get this guy to safety. Go back to the Lake. Look for a tent with a white flag with a circle and vertical line through it and I'll find you"
- We buried the old guy at the tree line
- Toshiro forgets to don his amulet before entering the town and everyone is looking at him like he's an outsider
- Balam puts some manacles on Toshiro and Cephos claims that they have captured an outsider and will deliver him in the morning
- They set up camp and Cephos leads Toshiro into one of the tents and Toshiro dons his amulet making him look more like a Hinoko again
- They take a long rest and in the morning Merric makes a large breakfast
- Bayarma asks for directions to the tavern with the circle and vertical line through it, she is told to ask one of the patrols and her and Toshiro goes to ask the nearby patrol and are informed it's called the Spliting Moon Inn and they proceed to give us directions and says they go there occasionally for drinks but it's not frequented by many
