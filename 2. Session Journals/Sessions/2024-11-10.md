- Battle with the Behir commences
- During battle the kobolds also attack us as well from little hiding spots
- We kill the Behir and the sorcerer kobold yells, "They killed it! Run!"
- Something continued to sting Cephos so everyone tried to get whatever is stinging him
	- Toshiro found it
	- Skashoon conjured 8 bats to find the bug stinging him to deal with it
	- Balam set the ground on fire below
- Toshiro grabs a handaxe from Merric and hacks the two horns off
- Balam then spends 6 hours carving off enough scales to make some form of armor
- Cephos thanks the group for setting out on this quest which was mostly Toshiro's fault
