- Cross paths with a couple of people dressed in brown robes Toshiro makes up a story about visiting a fallen friend to perform last rights but not being given specific directions
- We continue on and cross paths with another couple that look destitute and they ask us for help getting back to Salvation Lake and Toshiro gives them direction and Bayarma and Balam give them 2 rations to help them
- Toshiro spots some trees in the distance and starts heading towards them and then we see a third couple of people frantically running at us telling us to run
- Shortly after a large man bat looking thing flies out of the trees and at all of us
- We tell them to come towards us and as soon as they get past Bayarma/Cephos/Toshiro they draw weapons and attack us and say, "We tried to warn you away from here, now suffer the consequences"
- During combat we are ambushed by the others we pass/helped as well and one of the enemies get's knocked around a lot and transforms into a wolf man hybrid
