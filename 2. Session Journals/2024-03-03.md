- Cephos isn't really Cephos
- Toshiro was right? About his parentage and him not being a half orc maybe?
- The group keeps asking questions but getting limited or unclear answers
- Balam and Skashoon detect a strong druidic presence to the northwest and after a short discussion we head in that direction
- We come upon someone speaking druid
- Balam recognizes that he's trying to talk to the plants
- Balam talks to the plants and finds out they are angry with us and the other druid
- The other druid talks to Balam and asks her if she is willing to help clear the weeds
- Balam helps him clear the weeds after they start to attack us with vines
- His name is Jin and he hasn't met but has heard of Balam's master
- He says that Cephos is half yaowu but is just resting
- We set up camp in the burned area from the burned plants so we can be sure no weeds will attack us
- Jin teaches Balam through the night
    
    - Spell - Desiccate
    - Spell â€“ Invigorate (Basically haste without the downsides)
- Cephos finally wakes up after almost 2 days of sleeping
- We talk to Cephos about his half yaowu parentage
- Some hunters show up and are obviously taking more than their share
- Jin approaches them and tells them they have been an affront to nature and kills them
- He now looks like he is enraged (see image)
- After a small discussion he starts to attack us with elementals
- Next time we cross paths with the Eastern Talon we wish we hadn't
