- Jordo – fought against the fallen angels but was denied the same honors as the others and joined the fallen angels instead 
- Jordo's relatives searched for a cure so we may want to seek them out to get rid of the curse 
- We are going to take Riku to Relera but first we check him for hidden notes about the Sehi Jujin 
- He had no notes so we are going to use speak with dead on him and disguise Skashoon to look like Kiihar so that he gives up more info 
- We get 5 questions: 
    - Where is Ren Kama aka the Western Claw? 
        - "Don't know" 
    - Where is Jordo's relative in Obsos? 
        - "Don't know" 
    - What magic do we use to reveal the Sehi Jujin tattoos? 
        - "Lantern" 
    - Who are the others you are working with in Opalia? 
        - "Bantu and Chojin" 
    - What traps or defenses are under Bantu's? 
        - "Don't know" 
- Balam uses the Lantern of revealing on Riku and sees his tattoo on the side of his cheek 
- Sehi Jujin means "The End of Times" 
- Chojin took a good portion of Bayarma's family inheritance 
- We take the tattoo to Relera to show her how to reveal the Sehi Jujin 
- We catch her while she is conversing with Namso and we show her the tattoo and how to reveal it 
- She also notices that Cephos doesn't look so well and he shows her the cursed amulet 
- She calls Namso back in as he can remove curses 
- He tries but also gets stung by the feedback from trying to remove the amulet 
- We ask Namso if he knows where Han Li Ngo resides as we are searching for him for Balam, but he didn't know and adds that he likes to wander 
- Toshiro called for his owl last night and tried to send a message to update the queen saying that "He's seen the king but couldn't get close and he appeared to have been turned evil" and also gave a description of the woman who had him "enthralled"
