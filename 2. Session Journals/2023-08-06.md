- Overheard some locals at the bridge in the south saying that there is new more deadly/serious disease going around Yang Island and to be careful going through the area
- After a day's travel we take a day and go hunting
    - Small deer – 3 rations
    - Small black bear – 10 rations
        - Skashoon took the teeth and claws
- After getting to the bridge to Yang Island we ask about the tall blonde man in a black coat again
- He was seen going into the area about 8-10 days ago
- The affliction has been around for the same amount of time
- Tall blonde man was quite polite and didn't seem dangerous and stated he was from Vermilias
- After going into the diseased area, a voice calls out asking if we are investigating the disease
- We agree to join up with his camp and pool our resources for the night
- [[Ukki]] (short swords and daggers), [[Izum]] (magic), [[Chiset]] (healer), [[Miya]] (hammer/mace)
- Tall Blonde guy's name is [[Kiihar]]
- Left the group shortly after arriving in Zenzu and they have been tracking him ever since
- [[Izum]] sets and alarm spell but they have one person to keep watch, [[Skashoon]] and [[Balam]] take watch for us
- [[Miya]] is sitting in a tree doing her watch and looking at the stars and [[Skashoon]] tries to climb the tree to join her but fails
- They talk about [[Kiihar]] and finds out they were a group together for about 2 years and then after that he just left them
- Didn't seem out of the ordinary to [[Miya]]
- In the morning they are huddled around some food and then say they need to head out as their leader (name), needs them in the north (in the desert area)
- [[Chiset]] leaves us some potions and they pack up and head out
- Talk to a local in the infected area, and he points us in the direction that [[Kiihar]] set up camp (NE of camp)
- Tall pointy thing far in the distance to the south east
- We find [[Kiihar]] and his camp
- "You know the end times are coming. I'm just accelerating the process. I've finally perfected it. The fulminating death."
