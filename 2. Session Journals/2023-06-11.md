- The battle between the group and the crazy guy commences
- The battle started in the dungeon/tower thing and after the first round we get teleported
- The next area was grassy meadow with a chimera and a umberhulk
- The battle was long but as soon as we got close to the crazy guy we were teleported again
- This area is a desert and shortly after getting here a raging sand storm starts making the whole area difficult terrain
- There was also a camel that talked, except it wasn't a camel
- Bayarma died to lasers from the camel
- We take out the crazy guy
- Balam wakes up in the tower and proceeds to wake everyone else up
- The hat (Nengurak "The Star of Maniacs") on the crazy guy vanishes and then appears on Balam
- Nengurak is another part of Halcyon's Armory
- Now that we have 3 of them, we all level up
- The crazy guy was driven crazy by Nengurak because he tried to rob Nengurak and after being attacked he was transformed into a hat which the crazy guy put on
- The angel with the sinister voice was a fallen angel that owned the tower about 700 years ago
- We level up to level 8
