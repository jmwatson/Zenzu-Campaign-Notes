- very familiar voice (sounds like bayarma's mentor) - "leave the fighting to the moon brothers"
- we hear a the sound of an instrument (shoon)

- We get up the stairs into a long hallway and see some enemies and Toshiro notices caltrops along the floor
- Toshiro opens with a lightning bolt from Leitosen and hits all 5 of them and then they all run off
- Everyone makes it up the stairs and Balam uses a earth spell to move the caltrops out of the way and we proceed down the hall
- Toshiro makes his way down the hall and after the first doorway a guy runs out the second room with a small box (Bayarma's box) and Toshiro tries to trip him but fails and he runs off down the hall trying to escape
- He gets to the doorway and Merric and Skashoon both hit him with their attacks and Toshiro tries to tackle him but misses and falls to the ground
- We end up killing him and Toshiro pats him down for 12 G and moves the box off to the side
- Bayarma opens the box and inside is a letter explaining what is inside, a smaller white box that can generate restoration dust that will dissipate an hour after generation once per day
- Cephos has the box now
- We finally manage to exchange Bayarma's rusty great sword out for the +1 that Cephos had finally
- We explore the area as there are no immanent threats
- As soon as we enter the big room Merric casts light on Toshiro's weapon and they start to explore the room
- While walking around Toshiro gets a bad feeling and tells the party to be on guard and takes a defensive stance himself
- They are ambushed by extremely fast wolves and wolf/men hybrids (Yaowu)
- Toshiro gets hit a lot initially and then feared so he runs off to a separate room and shuts the door behind him while the rest of the party fights the wolf men
- He tries to work up the courage to get back into the fight but fails so he finally settles on helping from his safe area and commands the team on who to attack and taking pot shots
- Unfortunately one of the pot shots hits Cephos in the rear so now Toshiro has a thing for "juicy dumpers"
