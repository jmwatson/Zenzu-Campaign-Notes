- "My honored Zenzuese, today marks the halfway point of the Zenzu Games. Though there are winners and losers in the games, we must all remember these are friendly competitions. Because of the circumstances surrounding Zenzu today, I would like to talk about adversity and how we as a people will overcome any and all misfortunes Now, Lord Shodaku was supposed to be the key speaker at the Mid Game festival but he is still battling a strange illness, an example of the many difficulties that have befallen us during these times. My people, the Hinoko, are no stranger to misfortune however. Since the Fallen Wars we have been belittled, scorned, and have been the target of acts of prejudice by the other tribes. Yes it is true that during the Fallen Wars our tribe did side with the Fallen Angels, and although relations have much improved since those times, we have had to endure centuries of adversity. Thankfully, the Leaders of the Hinoko, past and present, have worked tirelessly to better our situation. And Lord Shodaku and I will continue to do so. The Hinoko are the greatest example of overcoming adversity through strength! And today I can proudly say, the Hinoko Are Great Always! As we have regained our honor and status, my people and I would like to toast the other tribes. Joining me are friends who have also aided the Hinoko and we offer a solution to our current demon problem
- < Hinoko turn into demons >
- You know what they say… if you can’t beat them… join them! Hinoko, it is time to right all the wrongs we have endured. Zenzu belongs to us. Show the rest of the tribes what TRUE POWER really means. THE HINOKO ARE GREAT ALWAYS!!!!
- Toshiro notices the brown hooded figure as Levain Gensling and reacts to that
- We are ushered away and told by Sunwei to help people fleeing and to find Relera
- Toshiro also notices that not all the Hinoko turned and that specifically the two from the Hinoko team that we talked with were helping fight the demons back
