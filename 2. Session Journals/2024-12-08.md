- As we enter the cave, Cephos asks Skashoon to hold out his hand and sniffs the scars from where he cut himself in the battle
- Toshiro consults Leitosen on which way he would take through the branches of the caves
- We come upon a little living area and a pile of bones with a desk that contained a couple of books
	- The first book seemed to be a diary
		- Journal of a Commander
			- We are in Year 746
			- the book is in Year 89
			- couldn't get the doors open until the doors magically opened
			- Described a room with 3 figurines and mural that the doors 
	- The second book is a diary
		- Journal of the pile of bones who died after the cave in and found out the mushrooms are poisonous
		- Occasionally there would be noises from the temple so the gnome built the shelves to block the noises
- We come upon a large chamber and realize that we have entered the temple
- Heading down a hallway we see a door and hear a voice asking (in riddle form) for a gold donation to continue
- We end up giving 450 GP to the door and it finally says "Heaven and Hell shall let you pass, do you proceed or do you pay more?"
- We decide to enter and the doors open
- The next room is the figurine room with the mural and some dwarven statues
- Cephos picks up the first figurine and Toshiro picks up the fighter looking figurine and then tosses it to Bayarma and then Toshiro picks up the third and final one that looks like a rogue and pockets it
- In the next room there is a large pit in the center of the room that seems endless and a passage to the south that is blocked
- A ghost calls out to have us put it to rest (it's the dwarf who was squished from out pre-campaign) so Cephos performs last rights on the dwarf
- The ghost tells us there are 3 more as she assends to her afterlife
- After re-entering the main room some skittering is heard from the pit and rust monsters appear out of the if along with a large blue rust(?) monster
