- The man being led around is not to be executed today but it will happen tomorrow at 8 PM
- Toshiro starts following the hanged man after the announcement of his execution but the rest of the group starts following as well
- Toshiro stops and tells Balam to try to follow while being undetected as an animal but when she transforms everyone around us notices her and freak out alerting the guards
- She flies in an unpredictable manner but the guards are firing at her and manage to hit her and she crashes into a tent
- She then misty steps away (a couple of times) to get some distance between her and her crash spot and then heads back toward camp
- Toshiro uses the commotion caused by Balam to sneak away from the group and follow the "hanged man" and his guards
- One of the guards not investigating Balam or guarding the "hanged man" stops Toshiro and asks him where he is headed, and Toshiro lies and says he's looking for work and points at a job board nearby
- Toshiro mills about near the job board until the guard leaves and then continues following the "hanged man" until they make a hard right turn and then he follows them parallel to their path
- From about a 75ft distance Toshiro watches them arrive and see them have a changing of guards as the group escorting take over for the existing guards and they leave
- Toshiro heads back to camp
- While all of that the remaining group decides to head back to camp
- While Balam is heading toward camp she spots someone she recognizes and as she passes by she gives him a little nod (it was Renzo)
- Once back at camp, Skashoon decides that he will conjure some large birds to look for Toshiro and Balam but they are immediately shot down
- Skashoon is surrounded by guards and questioned about the birds he conjured and he admits he did it and he is taken into custody and taken away
- The party at camp debate going to look for Balam and Toshiro but luckily the majority of the group decide to stay except for Bayarma who goes off to look for a guard to find out where they take people taken into custody
- Toshiro and then a little bit later Balam get back to camp and tell them their version of what happened when they got separated from the party and then they work on a plan for getting the "hanged man" out of trouble
- Kanata and his kids make it back to camp and Skashoon tries to get a stick from the boy and some mistletoe from the daughter, but fails pretty badly so Toshiro does a magic trick with some silver to trade the silver for the stick and and then offers to braid the daughters hair but Cephos steps in and does the braid instead and they give Skashoon both items for his spell
- Kanata asks where the old man is since he hasn't seen him since last night
- The group goes to the old man's tent and notices "old person" odor and notice the old man still laying down, they check him and he had died but had a small smile on his face
- Toshiro then suggests they use the old man's body instead of bags of rice to swap the "hanged man" and Cephos says he'll do some stuff to keep the body from smelling
- The final plan is to swap the "hanged man" for the old man's body to save him from execution and then leave town cause the guards will clamp down on town once they find out he's escaped
