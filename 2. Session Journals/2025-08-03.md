- Kanata sees us breaking down our camp and asks if we're leaving then tells us about a drunk he ran across earlier and told us about a person named Oyabun
- Oyabun - someone from Opalia and good with daggers and a good fighter
- Toshiro bundles up the old man and tries to carry him but can't quite manage it so he makes a makeshift stretcher from the old man's tent and uses that to drag him around
- Toshiro leads the party back to the tent he found earlier with the condemned man
- When they get close (80-100ft away) he stops the group and leaves the old man with the group
- Toshiro turns invisible and goes up to the right side of the tent but hears someone inside shuffling papers
- He lifts up the side of the tent to look inside and sees a pair of legs which he grabs and tries to pull out of the tent but fails to move them
- He lets go of the ankles and decides to slip under the side of the tent to get a better look at what is going on inside
- Once inside he sees an empty chair next to him and a man in a cell and at the entrance is a the guy whose legs he tried to grab telling the guards to check the back of the tent
- Then Toshiro hears something outside the tent and then someone says, "I saw them go that way, hurry and get them!"
- After that a man enters the tent from under the back like Toshiro did and Toshiro immediately recognizes him as Renzo
	- Toshiro: "Renzo!? What are you doing here?"
	- Renzo: "Who's there?"
	- Toshiro: "It's Toshiro"
	- Renzo: "I must be hearing things"
- Toshiro becomes visible again and Renzo hits him with a poisoned dagger, Toshiro takes off his amulet and says, "It's me, Toshiro"
- Renzo unlocks the cage with the man inside and hands Toshiro a vial, "Drink this and follow me"
- They all leave the tent out the back and run east
- While running Skashoon shows up next to Toshiro, "Where we going?" and Renzo hits Skashoon with a poisoned dagger
- Toshiro says, "They're with me." Renzo tosses Skashoon a vial and says, "Drink this and hurry."
