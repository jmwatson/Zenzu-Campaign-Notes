- Little girl is studying the druidic arts
- Little girl's master is the same as Balam's
- Little girl's name is Keri
- Disease is elven in nature and somehow related to Skashoon's blood (maybe his clan is involved)
- Keri mentions that a Yao fish could help but she is terrible at fishing so she sends us after one
- Yao fish are found in brackish water so we head south to find/catch one
- Yao fish are also cunning so we may have trouble catching it
- Don't catch any Yao fish on the first night
- Toshiro and Cephos capture a beautiful sunset in painting form (it's just a passable painting though)
- Get long rest
- This fish keeps getting away
- We finally catch the fish after multiple failed attempts and take it back to camp with us
- Put the fish in a pot and take him back to the camp
- Two people one fish happens (each person takes a barbell and warms it up with their hands)
- We get some serum into two vials
- We let the fish go and head immediately back to the diseased camp
- Keri makes the serum while Bayarma and Balam watch
- We wait now until the serum can take effect
- Keri informs us of a letter from Li Zhu Kong
- One of the first to get the serum starts to recover
- We give Keri the rest of the Yao fish secretion
- Han is visiting friends near Yin island
- Take some of the serum when we camp on the way back to Opalia in case we have the disease
- During first watch Toshiro hears a voice in his head and Cephos smells moose
- A mooman crashes into the camp before we can wake the party but collapses
- Darkness decends on the camp
