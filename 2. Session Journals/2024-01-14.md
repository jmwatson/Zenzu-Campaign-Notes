- Start off taking a long rest in the Vault of the Lost
- Head back to Fort Rubion
- Toshiro trained with Bayarma
- Head out toward the Guardian to get Toshiro and Cephos a cure for their affliction
- Get a little history of the war that happened 60 years ago between the Githyanki and the Southern Nation
- Continue to head toward the Guardian and come upon a shrine that says normies can't go any further out of respect.
- After heading up the mountain a blizzard descends upon us and we try to make shelter (leanto) but the winds in the blizzard are too strong for it and blow it apart
- We manage to find a cave to spend the night, but the next day the terrain has changed and we need help finding the path
- The hero weapons can help us as they glow when in close proximity of the path so we use that to make our way
- We come upon an entrance built into the mountain with four statues and a tablet with writing on it
- Elegy of the Fallen Angels - Let all who gaze upon me take heed of these words, lest they join forever these fallen four. Belthoriel, once the Angel of Victory, a powerful and unparalleled warrior. But countless victories over the millenia did nothing to sate the lust for battle. And so, driven by power, Victory turns to Conquest. Jinathe, once the Angel of Faith, a fervent being of holiness. But even the most holy can lose faith in the face of adversity. And so, wrought by despair, Faith turns to Corruption. Phenedross, once the Angel of Fortune, a benevolent spreader of prosperity. But sometimes fortune begets avarice. And so, immersed by greed, Fortune turns to Catastrophe. Myrstallas, once the Angel of Peace, a brilliant strategist for harmony. But the uncertainty of time can take its toll. And so, overcome by doubt, Peace turns to Chaos.
- The door is closed and won't open so we try putting all our hero weapons to the door to see if it will open for us
- The door opens a crack and loud booming voice calls out, "who dares try to enter the hall of heroes"
- We answer explaining that we are here seeking help with our disease
- A large silver dragon tells us we shouldn't be here yet in our journey and that we should have used the Zenzu entrance
- The Fulminating death was originally created by the angels
- Hemmenolath â€“ She can cure us but will need some time and we need to seek out some death finger mushrooms. Welcomes us to the Hall of Heroes. Zenzu entrance has the mushrooms we need, we just need to head down the west path.
- We head out the west entrance and arrive in the Golden Mountains and see some mushrooms and start harvesting them
- Some rednecks spot us and accuse us of stealing their mushrooms, we offer to pay but they aren't having any of that.
