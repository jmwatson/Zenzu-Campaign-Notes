- We set up camp for the night before trying to cross the bridges.
- Lord Shodaku
- Ryoto Shun is a holy man in the group
- While cooking starts Merric, Skashoon and Toshiro get into a little drinking party and start having a good time
- Merric gets tossed at Toshiro at some point in the night
- Hakuji Saito is the big barbarian in the group and he's the one who tossed Merric
- During the night the sister and her daughter take off and Balam wakes up Skashoon and they track them through the woods to the north
- At some point while tracking them Balam decides to head back and get the rest of us
- Cephos picks up Skashoon's scent trail and the group runs across an X on the ground which means that Skashoon is in peril
- Cephos keeps following his scent trail to the north
- At some point we come across two figures, one is Skashoon and the other between us is a mounted figure
- There is some discussion and the mounted figure tells us that the man escorting the girls had bad intentions and if we are open to following his lead, he will show us what Kizuna's real intentions were
- We come upon a camp and the mounted figure greets a knight and an older gentleman
- The knight is Shiku Furido (Phantom Knight)
- The old man is Senki
- After talking for a bit, flaming arrows land in the camp and set stuff on fire
