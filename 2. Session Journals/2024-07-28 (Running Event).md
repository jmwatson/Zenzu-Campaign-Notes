- Balam leads us off in the running event and sets us up with a pretty decent lead
- Skashoon runs second and keeps us in the race
- Bayarma brings us up in the third slot running, and manages to keep us in the top 3 spots
- Cephos runs the last leg of the race, with freedom of movement and some good rolls he wins the race for us
- As far as we can tell, after the unarmed combat event, Riku went back to his camp and he either timed it so no one was watching or somehow left without being noticed
- I relay that info the rest of the team and get some good natured ribbing of Cephos in.
- I notice two individuals, one male and one female, Tseren (male) and Sujin (female)
- Riku joined with only two days before the event
- Previous guy dropped out for unspecified reasons (Lien Sho's excuse)
- Lord Shodaku is now ill
- Toshiro is going to celebrate the mid ceremonies with them with lost of drink
- Cephos is going to try to offer his services to cure Lord Shodaku and maybe find out more about what is making him ill
- Cephos and Toshiro immediately think that he might have the fulminating death
