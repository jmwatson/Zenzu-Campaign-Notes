	- green flags are shops
	- blue flags are restaurants
	- white flags are inns

- Nakamura Akagi
	- Oten - Son
	- Akane - Young daughter
- I tell Kazuto that he may find purpose in life by helping those who need it more (hinting that he could help the Nakamura family)
- Sword, Axe and Lance all crossed on a badge to symbolize they are officials and doing patrols
