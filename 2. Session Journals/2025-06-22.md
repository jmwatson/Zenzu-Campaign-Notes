- We leave the cave
- Keri's mom is in on this as well
	- she got her hands on gems of undeath and that's how Keri tricked us
- Keri was snacking on sour gummy worms that Sehiju crafted for her
- during the long rest i see Otis and Mearl leave some supplies via cart in a clearing in the forest
- some shrouded (cloaked and masked)
- Toshiro tries to keep them from leaving by unhooking the horses from the cart but spooks them and they manage to leave before Toshiro can go get backup/get Skashoon to keep watch and follow his trail
- the next morning Toshiro tells the group what transpired during his watch and gets scolded for not waking the group
- we invite Keri/Otis/Mearl over for breakfast and Keri offers to make us food, which turned out to be dragon food and we couldn't handle the strength of it and it incapacitates Cephos, Balam, Toshiro, and Merric
- Otis and Mearl make us dinner and it's a proper southern meal
- those that have eaten the dragon meal can't taste food for the next 5 days
