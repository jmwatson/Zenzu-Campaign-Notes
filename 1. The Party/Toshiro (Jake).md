- Human Fighter

He is not from these lands but when he travelled here he found the [[Longhu]] tribe as the most accepting, but he still gets side glances and stares when he enters the room because he sometimes does some things that are not the norm.
 
Before he left Obsos, he was a battle instructor and taught many of the royal guard and some army regiments combat history and battle tactics. He was content to keep teaching the students that he had but a war broke out and his homeland was taken over by the invading army and he was exiled from his lands. He eventually made his way to [[Zenzu (Country â€“ West)]] where he has been putting his knowledge to use as a knight errant.
 
He is not really practiced at applying his combat knowledge and has been learning with each new encounter how to be a better fighter. He does however have an example to pull from for every battle he has been in that have helped him despite his lack of experience.
 
Despite his lack of desire to be social he is accustomed to talking to large groups from his teaching days. He also has many life lessons from his teachings that he will pull out from time to time (even when not applicable).
 
He also trained owls and various birds to carry messages to frontline battle groups and other bird stations around his homeland. He raised one owl from a chick until it carried its first message to the frontline. That was the last time he saw Revna, named because of her unusual jet black plumage that is speckled throughout its usual colorings of browns and white. Revna is of the species Little Owl. Their normal territories extend from Obsos into the northern parts of Zenzu.
 
He didn't get to grab much in the way of trinkets or keepsakes when his homeland was taken over, so each night before bed he calls out to Revna in the hopes that he can have a little bit of a connection to his homeland.
 
Toshiro's real name: Svender Berg  
His motto is: "He gets sent in when negotiations fail."
 
He is wondering if all this fate stuff is real since he is used to being a background character in other people's stories. He's trying to hide, why would some people from a war he knows very little about care about him and want him to be a hero. He'll help the others out with their quest, because he genuinely likes helping others, but he really doesn't believe in this fate stuff.
