    - Leader: Basayar Uurdogo
    - Based off **Mongolia**
- Hinoko
    
    - During the Fallen Angels war 800 years ago, this tribe sided with the Angels, and since their defeat, this tribe has been looked down upon by the others.
        
        - I repeat, this tribe has faced EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS of discrimination because it has been ingrained into society.
        - I don't want to direct character development, but for the majority of people in this region (and therefore likely your characters), they will subscribe to this train of thought as it is normal to them.
    - Only ONE player is allowed to be from this tribe, no exceptions. That player must have an exceptional background story and chance for character development.
        
        - If a player does get approved of this and think they're gonna be Rosa Parks or try to change 800 years of discrimination in a day or month, they will likely be very dead very fast.
    - Though the majority regret aiding the Angels, they often feel they are overly mistreated, even after all the time that has passed.
    - Values self-sufficiency, strength in oneself, fervent in their beliefs
    - Leader: Shodakun Kimuna
    - Based off **Japan**
- Verdalar - High Elves
    
    - The high elves don't participate in the Cycle of Renewal, but they respect the other tribes and largely keep to themselves in the northeastern part of Zenzu, along the border with Obsos.
    - Leader: Relera Imministel
        
        - Also leads the Council of Five in Opalia.
