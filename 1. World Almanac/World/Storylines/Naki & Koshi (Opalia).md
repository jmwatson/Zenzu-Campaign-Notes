Naki is Hido's wife, Koshi their daughter.
  
Koshi has beenÂ Cursed with a Demonic Curse.
- She acquired this curse a few days* ago.
- Hido was attacking the Traghaan Eagles to raise 500 gold to pay to a supposed 'healer' to cure Koshi
- Bayarma managed to cure some of the "curse" with her lay on hands ability
- Cephos talked with a local church and setup for them to stop by periodically to perform the same ritual to prevent Koshi from getting worse while we try to figure out what is happening to her
